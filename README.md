# ðŸ¤– Personal AI Agent Chatbot

This project implements a personal AI agent chatbot using Python, Chainlit, OpenAI SDK, Gemini API, and integrates with a Next.js API handler to fetch dynamic data. The chatbot can greet users, answer questions about Owais Abdullah, and fetch real-time data from a custom API.

## How it Works

1. **Greeting**: When a user starts a conversation, the chatbot greets the user and introduces itself.
2. **Data Retrieval**: If a user asks for specific details (e.g., "Tell me about your skills"), the chatbot will call the custom API to fetch relevant data and respond.
3. **Integration**: The chatbot uses OpenAI's GPT model to interpret user input and decide when to fetch data from the API or respond with pre-defined messages.

## Example Interaction

- **User**: "What are your skills?"
- **AI**: "I have expertise in **TypeScript**, **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Python**, **AI Integrations**, and more. Let me fetch detailed information about my skills from my profile."
